#  Before printing the jig

## 1. Printer calibration

You need to compensate the XY shrink of your filament.

Check your printer calibration and filament calibration, every filament had shrinkage. Print a 100mm piece and measure when it's cool, put your measurements in filament XY compensation part.

The printed part needs to measure 130mm, if you don't make this your part eventually measure 128.5-129mm and the 80/60mm marks will be displaced 1-1.5mm.

You need to print the holder to ensure the extrusion it's flat when drilling!

## 2. Two versions available.

20GT version is weaker but maybe you have worn out 20GT pulleys.

The bearing version requires MR115 bearings, can work with one bearing, recommended 2 bearings, lasts forever :)
